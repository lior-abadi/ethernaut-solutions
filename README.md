# ethernaut-solutions
Solutions for each challenge of the Ethernaut Game made by OpenZeppelin. You can check it out by visiting: https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/

## Structure
Each level has two sections. Catch and Solution.

### Catch
This is an overview of every level without giving the solution. This is a sort of hint-based description that gives an approach on how the level can be solved.
Also, sometimes it gives a context of the key concept of the problem.

### Solution
A detailed explanation of what is going on and the solution *per-se*. Some levels require further analysis and depth and may include python scripts or 
other ways of information just to make it more understandable.

Hope you enjoy this!
